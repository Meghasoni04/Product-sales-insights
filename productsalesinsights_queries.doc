<p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am writing to express my keen interest in the Data Analytics &amp; Support Intern position at Norstella. With hands-on experience in business analytics and a solid foundation in SQL, Power BI, and Excel, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Norstella&rsquo;s mission of accelerating access to life-saving therapies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my recent role as a Sales and Data Analyst at Satyam Balajee Automotive, I leveraged Power BI and Excel to track KPIs, analyze market trends, and optimize sales strategies. My projects included building dashboards for performance monitoring and using SQL to derive actionable insights from large datasets. I also developed customer segmentation models and sales forecasting tools, demonstrating my ability to turn raw data into strategic decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What draws me to Norstella is your impactful work at the intersection of data and healthcare. I am particularly motivated by the chance to support analytics efforts that can ultimately improve patient outcomes. I am confident that my analytical mindset, eagerness to learn, and collaborative nature will make me a valuable addition to your team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with Norstella&rsquo;s goals. I am available for an interview at your convenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Megha Soni</p>
